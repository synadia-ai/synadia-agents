"""Pre-publish validation helpers per protocol §5.4.

§5.4 requires the caller to enforce the prompt endpoint's capability metadata
(``max_payload`` + ``attachments_ok``) BEFORE publishing. Failing locally
spares a round trip and the agent-side "reject with 400" path. Agents MAY
additionally enforce server-side — but a spec-compliant caller MUST fail
locally first.

These helpers are pure: they take the already-parsed capability fields and
the candidate payload shape, and raise a :class:`ValidationError` subclass
(``PromptEmptyError`` / ``AttachmentsNotSupportedError`` /
``PayloadTooLargeError``) on violation. The integration point lives in
:meth:`Agent.prompt`.

    Two caps bind a publish:

    1. ``max_payload_bytes`` — the agent's advertised limit (from its
       ``$SRV.INFO`` metadata, §2.1). What the *agent's* broker accepts.
    2. ``connection_max_payload`` — the *caller's* own
       ``nc.max_payload`` (from the local NATS server's INFO block).
       What the broker holding the caller's connection will publish at
       all. In multi-cluster / per-account deployments this can be
       smaller than the agent's advertised cap, in which case the
       caller's broker rejects the publish with
       ``MAX_PAYLOAD_VIOLATION`` before it ever reaches the agent.

    The effective cap is ``min`` of whichever are set. ``None`` for
    either means "not declared / not known" — when both are ``None`` we
    don't enforce locally and let the server decide (§5.4 last
    paragraph).

    ``header_bytes`` is the framed wire size of the ``Agent-Sender``
    header the request will carry (sender-identity extension): the server
    applies ``max_payload`` to headers and payload together, so the check
    counts both. nats-py does **not** count headers in its own
    ``MaxPayloadError`` check, so this is the only guard before the
    server closes the connection with ``Maximum Payload Violation``.
